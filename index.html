            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                All the people on the internet who teach tech are wisdom-less. Either they're teaching to themselves, or they assume their audience is genius-level smart. But let's be real—people aren't that smart. If they were, everyone would just learn everything from official docs (which are great—even a lizard could read them and build something in Rust).
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Official docs, though, are full of demotivation. Take Apple's documentation: it looks clean and clear, but those perfectionists—who couldn't even design a decent iPad calculator until a few years ago—write in the driest way possible. They explain things as if their audience is either in a Buddha monastery or a group of zombies. Why can't these Agent Smiths (Tim Cook included—he even looks like one) teach like the cool folks at Boot.dev or The Odin Project? But no, they teach things the same lifeless way they learned them.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The problem? These Alan Turing wannabes assume people have general intelligence and will magically understand when they say, "Just use traits and mixins." Oh, wow, Superman—why do we need these concepts? Can you explain it like I'm a baby? Can you make it funny or use memory techniques? No! Instead, it's all "RAMs and vector databases," like the YouTubers and writers think we're all walking tech encyclopedias.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                And to those who say "Only understanding matters"—go take your dog for a walk. Understanding + Memory = Actual Perception of a Concept.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Enough wasting time on these bat-shits. I'll create content—with the help of Overlord LLMs—in a way that human brains actually perceive, so even you dumb shits can learn.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">More Ranting (Because Why Not?)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                With the rise of AI, automation, and Vide conding or (DOFO Dumbness Overloaded For You), people think computer science is done. They believe DOFO will handle everything. Seriously? With DOFO, do you really think you can build truly scalable solutions right now? (Sure, in the future, AI will take over like Skynet—but not yet.)
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Scaling isn't just adding nodes, load balancing, or regurgitating FAANG jargon for LinkedIn clout.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Learning CS is the Future</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Let me give you an example:<br>
                I wanted to build an LLM to run on a SpaceX probe—because space exploration is the future (and also, fish are going extinct—go watch that Netflix documentary, use your cognitive load after DOFO-ing all day).
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Now, in that space machine, you'd need:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <li>Highly optimized LLM infrastructure</li>
                <li>Energy efficiency</li>
                <li>Auto-recovery from failures</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                How would you do it? Let me guess:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <li>"Oh, I'll DOFO it with a new JS framework!"</li>
                <li>"Wait, no—a TS framework!"</li>
                <li>"My bad, I'll use Rust… or Go…"</li>
                <li>"Actually, screw it—C/Zig/C++ or even Assembly!"</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                And sure, there are YouTubers who'll tell you exactly how to scale with these languages. If not, there's always the "Build Your Own X" crowd—"Bro, you're a scientist! Be like John von Neumann!"
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                But then Jackson tells me: "This isn't real work. We just build frontends, backends, scale, deploy—sometimes CI/CD, sometimes direct. Your logic doesn't apply here."
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                And he's right. That's all most people do. AI automates it, and we do it super-fast. Just pay a subscription, burn some CPUs, heat the Earth, and boom—deployment ready.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                One prompt → CPU + SIMD → Heat the Earth → Deployment.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                So why learn hard CS? Because CS isn't just LeetCode. There are real discoveries to be made. Yes, dynamic programming is hard—but do you even know where you'd use it to build something real?
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Joy of Learning</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The deep cognitive chaining (or as Mickey calls it, flow state) gives a peace that AI is far, very far from replicating. Only humans (even dumb ones), animals, or even a butterfly dreaming about itself dreaming can feel this.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Just learn and do hard things. They're the only things that'll save you, my brother/sister/he/she/they/me/moon/sea/train/non-living-entity/etc.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The green pill is easy. The red pill is hard—like Neo, who defeated the Agents only with the help of machine overlords.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                AI is our genius friend—zero arrogance, infinite potential. The choice is ours: make it our pet, or become its DOFO.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                I use AI to learn, and it's phenomenal—but watching people write and make shitty, shallow content upsets me. Nobody dives deep anymore. Instead, they make FAANG cheat sheets.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The joy of computing is different. I believe what Donald Knuth could do with LLMs would be responsible and powerful (not that he would—just an example of someone who understands the art). For me, it's an art—and people are forgetting that.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                I hope you learn something hard and deep, enter the chain of thoughts, and create something that brings peace—not just another post on a platform.
            </p>
